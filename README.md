## What is q?
q is a typechecking library, but it's built to run without having to rewrite the
compiler. It's built to run on top of vanilla Lua, which means that it's
compatible with a couple of versions of Lua, namely 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and LuaJIT.

## Why should I use q?
q is built to reduce the amount of type errors in your code. It has a simple
syntax that is easy to use, and it's built to be used in everyday Lua code. It's
also built to be used in Roblox, which means that you can use it in your Roblox
projects.

## Why should I use q over other typechecking libraries?
q is built to be used in Roblox, but it's also built to be used in any other Lua
environment. It's built to be used in any Lua version, and it's built to be used
in any Lua implementation. It's built to be used in any situation that you can
think of. q is dynamic, meaning that it checks during the runtime of your code,
so you can check dynamic types over static types. For more information, see the
documentation.

Just an honorable mention: this project is powered by
[Moonwave](https://github.com/evaera/moonwave). I would recommend using Moonwave
with your own projects, as it's a great tool for building Lua documentation.
